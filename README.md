# REAL ESTATE AGENCY 
This app is designed in order to digitize and streamline the processes of a real estate agency. It provides a centralized platform for managing properties, clients, employees and the entire lifecycle of a real estate transaction. Customers can enquire about the availability of a property and get in contact with one of the employees over the facilities that the listed properties possess. This Java-based app focuses strictly on facilitating the sale of a property and also providing a better experience for both agents and customers, this being some of our main objectives.

### MAIN FEATURES AND RELATIONSHIPS

Property catalog: Add, edit, delete properties (apartments, houses, land, etc.), with full details (price, area, number of rooms, photos, location, features);

Customer management: Creating customer profiles (prospect buyers, sellers, renters), storing interaction history and preferences;

Employee Management: Create profiles for real estate agents, assign properties, track performance;

Advanced Search: Allows customers to search for properties based on multiple criteria (price, location, number of rooms, etc.);

Inheritance: For example, an abstract class "Person" can be inherited by classes "Customer" and "Agent".

Composition: A property is composed of features, a customer has preferences.
